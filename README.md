# Code Quiz

This project aimed to create a functional code quiz using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap Library), and JavaScript. This project was an assignment for Unit 5 Web APIs for UCLA's Coding Bootcamp.

[Deployed Gitpage](https://jonnahmarie.github.io/Code-Quiz/)

With the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

This quiz was very challenging in all aspects. I received help from my tutor Emily and TA Matt. I had issues running the timer on minutes and seconds without it glitching when seconds decremented with each penalty, so I decided on keeping it simple and counting down in seconds.

I had issues with my all of the indices in the object array of questions populating in my quiz. It would do go through every other question, however I was able to fix it to an extent by adjusting syntax of where 'i' would increment.

I had issues getting the score and initials to populate in the score page, so I have not fulfilled that criteria of this assignment.

This assignment was a challenge and I would definitely like to come back at a later date to conquer it.
